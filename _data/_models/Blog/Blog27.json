Whites wines aged in oak, such as Marsanne based or Viognier, are a good pairing. If you are looking for a red, try a light earthy wine like Beaujolais from France or Dolcetto d'Alba from Italy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>At dinners, keep it classic with pinot noir</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;When looking for a traditional wine to pair with your holiday meal, pinot noir from Oregon or California are the usual suspects.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Or buck tradition with a vintage port</strong></p>\n<p>Vintage ports are amazing with gravy and all the sauces that are served along the main dish.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pair bubbles with dessert</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;With sweets, bubbles are great! Sparkling rose offers a great acidity and a nice fizz.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Look for something rich&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Steer clear of light, crisp wines. They aren&rsquo;t generally rich enough to pair with holiday meals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>When in doubt...go for champagne</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Champagne is synonymous with celebration!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Want to learn more about wine?
