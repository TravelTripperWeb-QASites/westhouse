Take the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fireislandferries.com/\" class=\"\">ferry</a>&nbsp;(cars aren&rsquo;t allowed), and spend the day biking or beaching on this 31 mile-long barrier spit of sand and pine woodlands.

Roam the woods and meadows of Storm King for an up-close look at some of the biggest names in 20th century art—all under the watchful eyes of the gentle Hudson Valley mountains that inspired artists like Thomas Cole and Albert Bierstadt the century before.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><b>For the Farm-to-Table Scene</b></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><a href=\"https://www.stonebarnscenter.org/\">Stone Barns Center for Food &amp; Agriculture</a>, Pocantico Hills, NY</p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\">25 miles north; 45 minutes by car; 1.5 hours by train<br><br><img height=\"664\" src=\"http://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/8972/original/Ben-Hider-LBJH5522.jpg\" width=\"996\"><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><i>Photo courtesy of Stone Barns Center for Food &amp; Agriculture.</i><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\">Chef Dan Barber&rsquo;s mission? Create a healthy and sustainable food system that benefits everyone. A lofty task, but one that his 80-acre, nonprofit farm is working hard to fulfill. Each year, it welcomes thousands of visitors (including 7,000 students) to witness sustainable agriculture in the works, and to taste the benefits at the much-lauded onsite restaurant <a href=\"https://www.bluehillfarm.com/\">Blue Hill</a>. No mere afterthought, Blue Hill&rsquo;s main room is a reservations-only, fine-dining affair that is a New York Times favorite. A more casual counter area accepts walk-ins if you forget to book a table, and the experience is just as great.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><b>For the History Scene</b></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\">Sleepy Hollow, NY</p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\">29 miles north; 45 minutes by car; 1.25 hours by train<br><br><img height=\"664\" src=\"http://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/8992/original/6274542476_b387d3a414_b_(1).jpg\" width=\"995\"><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><br></p><p>Yes, that Sleepy Hollow.
