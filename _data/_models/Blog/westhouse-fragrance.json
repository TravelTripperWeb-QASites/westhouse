WestHouse selected leading olfactory company 12.29 to custom-design its scent based on the hotel&rsquo;s character. We spoke with the 12.29&rsquo;s scent director Dawn Goldworm (pictured above left, with her sister Samantha Goldworm, who handles 12.29&rsquo;s business side) to learn more about the process.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>WestHouse:</b> How did you get into this line of work? Have you always had a sensitive sense of smell?</p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>Dawn Goldworm:</b> I interned at Avon when I was a studying Art History and Business at NYU. I got on well with the fragrance director, who sent me to a perfumer school to get tested. Surprisingly, I tested really well! He told me he&rsquo;d train me in perfumery, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was interested. (I&rsquo;d thought I&rsquo;d work in fashion.) I said yes, though, trained for eight years and fell in love.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>And you worked with Avon that whole time?</b></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Yes, and then Coty Beauty in New York and Paris before I left to create 12.29.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>You&rsquo;ve helped celebrities create their fragrances. Who are some recent favorites?</b></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">I worked with Heidi Klum, and my last celebrity collaboration was Lady Gaga.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>How was the inspiration for their scents different?</b></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Heidi was all about her image—what she represents when she models, and when she does her different jobs; Lady Gaga was focused on her music: the shape of her music, the hook.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>How do you go about turning that inspiration into a scent? Can you take us through the process?</b></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">I bring every client through the same proprietary creative process, where I take all the pieces—colors, texture, music, who they&rsquo;re talking to, the emotion. I take it all and, with my understanding of global olfactic preference, I turn it into a scent.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>So from a brand&rsquo;s colors and texture, you can find a matching scent?</b></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">I have synesthesia, so I smell, hear and touch in color. I can see how it links because I know what I&rsquo;d see if I smelled it. But it&rsquo;s not subjective: If I give people a color board and a scent, they&rsquo;ll match the scent to the same color, because scent and emotion live in the limbic part of the brain, and the one section that&rsquo;s connected to scent is color. My synesthesia and training help me understand the reverse of that—taking the color and finding a scent.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>How did that process look for WestHouse?</b></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">WestHouse is amber, dark, mysterious and smoky. It&rsquo;s got that sexy old New York feeling that makes you want to have a cocktail and a romance. It&rsquo;s a private hotel that you need a key to get in, so we needed to create a scent to match. The WestHouse fragrance, &ldquo;Sanctuary,&rdquo; uses warm spices like nutmeg and cinnamon, deep and smoky guaiac wood, a subtle hint of tobacco and amber resins.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>Are people surprised to learn that what they are smelling has been specifically designed and pumped in?</b></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Maybe, but I like to think of it as a seduction. Enjoy it! It seduces you like the music does. </p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b>What does New York smell like to you?</b></p><p>New York City smells like gasoline, peanuts, garbage, hotdogs, grass, horses and, in the summer...ice cream. The perfume of NYC is the best smell!!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Photo by Mark Squires courtesy of 12.29.</i></p>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"]}
