Here, NOMI Beauty&rsquo;s Artist Coordinator Sheri Newton shares her can&rsquo;t-fail beauty tips for the modern woman on the go.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Apply a moisturizer before applying makeup.</strong> <br />&ldquo;<strong>Embryolisse</strong>, always a staple in my artist kit, is great for all skin types and can be used to massage the face, which boosts circulation and eliminates dryness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Use bronzer to warm and highlight skin.</strong> <br />&ldquo;Apply bronzer, such as <strong>Makeup Forever Pro Bronze Fusion Bronzer</strong>, with a brush in a number 3 pattern starting at the temple, then cheek, and working down to the jawline.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Use conditioning lip balm with SPF</strong><br />&ldquo;Make it a habit to apply lip balm before starting any makeup application. This will give the product time to set in on the lips, eliminating dryness and keeping them plump and moisturized for lipstick or lip gloss application.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Opt for moisturizing lip gloss.</strong><br /> &ldquo;Choose a moisturizing gloss with minimal shimmer, which can leave lips dry. I <strong>love Lorac Alter Ego</strong> lip glosses. They&rsquo;re highly-pigmented, contain antioxidants and have a soft vanilla scent...and they don&rsquo;t leave a tacky feel on the lips.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Go for black mascara</strong> <br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the perfect travel companion. I carry <strong>Makeup Forever Excessive Lash Mascara</strong> for both my customers and my own personal use. The easy applicator brush deposits just the right amount of product for both eyelashes, without any clumping.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Makeup remover cleansing tissues are a must have.</strong> <br />&ldquo;I love <strong>Absolute New York Makeup Cleansing Tissues</strong>, which contain green tea extract, are not oily and smell like a spa. They are perfect for removing makeup or as a refresher.&rdquo;</p>","thumbnail":{"url":"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1031/media/WestHouse-Hotel-NOMI-Beauty-Tips.jpg"}}
