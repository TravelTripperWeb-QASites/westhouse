That&rsquo;s why we sat down with Emily Elyse Miller&mdash;founder and creative director of Trends on Trends, a culinary trend forecasting agency, and curator of the WestHouse Dine Around guide&mdash;to find out where to eat and drink in New York City.</p>\n<p>On avoiding tourist traps and seeking out local, quality restaurants:</p>\n<p>The first thing I do is search for local blogs that cover culinary recommendations. When I see a dish or restaurant repeated across a few sites, I add it to my list. I use Google Maps to &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; places I&rsquo;m interested in, so when I&rsquo;m wandering in a new city, I know what&rsquo;s nearby. It makes it easy to pop in and out of several restaurants.</p>\n<p>I also like a good balance of high and low&mdash;it&rsquo;s exciting to try buzzy new restaurants, but without noshing on the local street food or more casual, off-the-beaten-path spots, it&rsquo;s hard to capture the true pulse of the city and the culinary routines of the people who live there. A combination of the two leaves me with an accurate point of view of the cuisine in a new city.</p>\n<p>On chefs beginning to backtrack to the &rsquo;70s:</p>\n<p>From fashion to design to food, the &rsquo;70s are back across the board&mdash;but with a contemporary spin. The dining scene in New York is experiencing a return of classic &rsquo;70s-style desserts, like the vacherin (French or Swiss cow&rsquo;s milk cheese) at Vaucluse. Then, there&rsquo;s casual lunch counter-style spots, like the vintage Mr. Donahue&rsquo;s in Nolita. Flowing into the cocktail scene, the fern bar&mdash;a term for preppy bars that originated in the late &rsquo;70s and named for their decor, which included ferns and other greenery&mdash;is seeing a comeback with spots like the retro-styled Oleanders in Williamsburg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vaucluse: 100 E. 63rd St., 646-869-2300</p>\n<p>Mr. Donahue&rsquo;s: 203 Mott St., 646-850-9480</p>\n<p>Oleanders: 160 North 12th St., Brooklyn, 718-218-7500</p>\n<p>On where to eat the most important meal of the day:</p>\n<p>Breakfast has become more than an on-the-go meal before work, and restaurants in the city are making an effort to serve a full weekday morning menu&mdash;creating a return of the power breakfast. Lafayette and Buvette are my favorite spots for it in New York.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lafayette: 380 Lafayette St., 212-533-3000</p>\n<p>Buvette: 42 Grove St., 212-255-3590</p>\n<p>On her new way to spark conversations:</p>\n<p>BreakfastClub is a series that I started where I bring chefs, editors and influencers together, in the morning, for a family-style meal prepared by a chef who doesn&rsquo;t normally serve breakfast. The focus is on creative conversations enjoyed over delicious food.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On how she curated restaurants for the WestHouse Dine Around guide:</p>\n<p>WestHouse is chic&mdash;so I focused on experiences ranging from the city&rsquo;s most lauded Michelin-starred tables along with New York classics that have won the hearts of locals. &ldquo;Cereal Milk&rdquo; ice cream from Momofuku Milk Bar, for example, has practically become a rite of passage&mdash;most New Yorkers have tried it at least once. I also curated the guide so guests can enjoy the best New York has to offer any time of day, including coffee, desserts, snacks, drinks and entrees&mdash;with enough options to create a Dine Around day of their own. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Momofuku Milk Bar: 15 W. 56th St., 347-577-9504</p>"}
