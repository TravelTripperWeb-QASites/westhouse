It&rsquo;s the perfect time for a picnic in New York City. You might think that being a crowded island, Manhattan wouldn&rsquo;t have many options for a luxurious picnic. You&rsquo;d be wrong. Ask our WestHouse concierge to help set up a picnic delivery from some of New York&rsquo;s best restaurants or companies like <a href=\"https://www.perfectpicnicnyc.com/\" id=\"mfa17\">Perfect Picnic</a> and spend an afternoon at one of these beautiful spots right here in the concrete jungle.</div><div id=\"mf113\"><br></div><div id=\"mf115\"><b>Fort Tryon Park</b></div><div id=\"mf117\"><br></div><div id=\"mf119\">This quiet Washington Heights park delivers a welcome respite from the city crowds. The Met Museum&rsquo;s Cloisters are here, as is a delightful rose garden. High above the Hudson, a European-style plaza overlooks the river and the leafy palisades across, making for one of the most romantic sunset spots in the city. Wooden benches and gentle sloping fields make are great picnic spots.</div><div id=\"mf120\"><br></div><div id=\"mf122\"><b>East River Park</b></div><div id=\"mf124\"><br></div><div id=\"mf126\">Lawns in this East Side park provide sweeping views of the Williamsburg Bridge, whose massive steel truss towers were inspired by the Eiffel Tower. Picnic in the grass while ferries, tugs and leisure boats pass by, and take a post-lunch walk along the riverfront promenade, completed in 2010.</div><div id=\"mf127\"><br></div><div id=\"mf129\"><b>Piers 62 - 64</b></div><div id=\"mf131\"><br></div><div id=\"mf133\">The nearby Highline may have more interesting landscaping—these piers are simple expanses of grass lined with trees—but good luck finding a spot to sit down and relax. We much prefer these large riverfront fields when picnicking in Chelsea. Children will love the carousel.</div><div id=\"mf134\"><br></div><div id=\"mf136\"><b>Battery Park</b></div><div id=\"mf138\"><br></div><div id=\"mf140\">Downtown&rsquo;s premier greenspace, Battery Park is a graceful collection of gardens and winding paths at the very base of Manhattan. Financial District high rises loom above it and ferries bound for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island depart from its waterfront. Jump aboard—or just sit and watch the action go by.</div><div id=\"mf141\"><b><br></b></div><div id=\"mf144\"><b>Central Park</b></div><div id=\"mf146\"><br></div><div id=\"mf148\">In designing Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted built one of the most iconic places to lay down a picnic blanket. Set up your spread in the wide expanses of Sheep Meadow, the Great Lawn or Great Hill for panoramic skyline views. Kids, or as we like to call them, &ldquo;Little Residents,&rdquo; may want to head to the park&rsquo;s East Side and dine under the shadow of the Balto statue, made famous by the animated film on the heroic Alaskan sled dog, at 66th street, or at the Alice in Wonderland statue ten blocks up.</div><div id=\"mf149\"><br></div><div id=\"mf151\"><b>The Terrace</b></div><div id=\"mf153\"><br></div><div id=\"mf155\">Here at WestHouse, our 23rd floor <a href=\"http://www.westhousehotelnewyork.comwesthouse-hotel-new-york-dining/the-terrace\" id=\"mfa18\">terrace</a> is the back patio of your dreams, and a beautiful, exclusive spot to have a picnic. Lofted above the bustling streets, look out to the Hudson River and the high rises of midtown while relaxing during our daily High Tea service or with a cocktail and savory bites.</div><p id=\"mf156\"><br></p>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"],"image":{"url":"/assets/images/7922/original/Screen-shot-2015-07-23-at-1.54.37-PM.png"}}
