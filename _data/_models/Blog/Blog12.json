From July 25 until August 19, enjoy a 3-course lunch and dinner for $29 and $42, respectively. Here&rsquo;s a selection of our favorite Midtown restaurants on the list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>21 Club&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>One of the most famous Prohibition-era speakeasies from the &rsquo;30s, the Bar Room restaurant at 21 Club has served the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Luciano Pavarotti and George Clooney in its 80-year history. From chilled seafood to signature grills, the famous &agrave; la carte menu has something for everybody. This Restaurant Week, start with the soup du jour, and don&rsquo;t miss the grilled flat iron steak.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>21 Club: 21 W. 52nd St., 212-582-7200&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>China Grill&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Located on the ground floor of the CBS headquarters, China Grill has been the go-to spot for power lunches and dinners in an opulent setting since its opening in 1987. And while the restaurant scene has changed greatly, China Grill is still a stalwart supporter of the Asian fusion concept. Its Peking duck salad, serving it in tangerine orange dressing has stood the test of time&mdash;and restaurant critics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>China Grill: 60 W. 53rd St., 212-333-7788&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Russian Tea Room&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Founded by former members of the Russian Imperial Ballet in 1927, the Russian Tea Room has played host to high-brow actors, writers and politicians for nearly a century. (Madonna worked the coat check before becoming an international celebrity.) Sample Russian favorites on the Restaurant Week menu, from goat cheese and wild mushroom blinchik&mdash;a Russian take on the cr&ecirc;pe&mdash;to vareniki, a daily selection of Russian-style pierogi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Russian Tea Room: 150 W. 57th St., 212-581-7100&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Brasserie Ruhlmann&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Dine al fresco surrounded by public art, or sit inside an art-deco dining room with mahogany wood and red velvet chairs at this Paris-inspired brasserie. Chef Laurent Tourondel of BLT Steak fame created a sophisticated French menu this Restaurant Week, featuring grilled hanger steak and the classic moules marini&egrave;res with white wine and shallots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brasserie Ruhlmann: 45 Rockefeller Plz., 212-974-2020&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Esca&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Esca brings southern Italian dishes to Midtown Manhattan with the star power of chef Mario Batali. The Restaurant Week menu includes a selection of fresh crudo&mdash;local bluefish with pickled jalapeno, bluefin tuna loin with olive oil from Sicily and shrimp with house made lemon oil&mdash;and, for dessert, cannoli with fresh ricotta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Esca: 402 W. 43rd St., 212-564-7572</p>"}
