A true misnomer, the biannual celebration runs roughly a month long (until August 14), and invites diners to discounted, prix-fixe dinners and lunches at Manhattan&rsquo;s best restaurants. It&rsquo;s the perfect excuse to visit Michelin-starred restaurants at welcomingly low prices (lunches are $25; dinners $38).</div><div id=\"mf112\"><br></div><div id=\"mf114\">Here are the New York City Michelin-starred restaurants participating in this summer&rsquo;s Restaurant Week, and our recommended course selections.</div><div id=\"mf115\"><br></div><div id=\"mf117\"></div><div id=\"mf118\"><a href=\"http://www.aifiorinyc.com/\" id=\"mfa17\"><b>Ai Fiori</b></a></div><div id=\"mf120\">Take the wide spiral staircase up to Ai Fiori (pictured above), and you&rsquo;ll find yourself in an elegant but understated room of polished woods and tufted banquettes: It&rsquo;s the food that chef (and pasta god) Michael White wants you to focus on.</div><div id=\"mf121\"><br></div><div id=\"mf123\">Courses to order: Housemade pâté; pappardelle with mushroom, tomato and ricotta (you can&rsquo;t go to a Michael White restaurant without ordering his pasta); dark chocolate torta.</div><div id=\"mf124\"><br></div><div id=\"mf126\"><i>Available for lunch, Monday through Friday.</i></div><div id=\"mf128\"><br></div><div id=\"mf130\"><a href=\"http://www.andanada141.com/\" id=\"mfa18\"><b>Andanada</b></a></div><div id=\"mf132\">The 2015 Michelin Guide hails Andanada as an &ldquo;unselfconscious Spanish powerhouse,&rdquo; and we wholeheartedly agree. Bullfighting scenes line the brick dining room, and a welcomingly friendly waitstaff reminds us all that fine-dining shouldn&rsquo;t have to come with an attitude.</div><div id=\"mf133\"><br></div><div id=\"mf135\">Courses to order: Andalusian tomato emulsion with jamón; Mallorca flatbread with peppers; melon gelée soup with lemon sorbet.</div><div id=\"mf136\"><br></div><div id=\"mf138\"><i>Available for lunch and dinner, Monday through Friday.</i></div><div id=\"mf140\"><br></div><div id=\"mf142\"><a href=\"http://www.charliepalmer.com/liberty-room-at-aureole/\" id=\"mfa19\"><b>Aureole - Liberty Room</b></a></div><div id=\"mf144\">Naysayers be damned, Times Square actually has a restaurant worth braving the crowds. Charlie Palmer&rsquo;s Aureole, including its semi-casual Liberty Room, serves up contemporary American food in a brightly lit (though thankfully not neon) atmosphere with wine displayed on a hanging catwalk.</div><div id=\"mf145\"><br></div><div id=\"mf147\">Courses to order: Heirloom tomato gazpacho; trout with wild rice and daikon; peanut butter crunch with chocolate mousse and bacon caramel ice cream.</div><div id=\"mf148\"><br></div><div id=\"mf150\"><i>Available for lunch and dinner Monday through Friday; dinner on Sunday.</i></div><div id=\"mf152\"><br></div><div id=\"mf154\"><a href=\"http://www.cafeboulud.com/nyc/\" id=\"mfa20\"><b>Café Boulud</b></a></div><div id=\"mf156\">Daniel Boulud&rsquo;s restaurant empire takes an intimate turn at this Upper East Side retreat where the kitchen churns out one French classic after the other. Executive pastry chef Ashley Brauze&rsquo;s delicate baked goods are not to be missed—she&rsquo;s previously worked at El Bulli under Albert Adrià, and Per Se under Thomas Keller.</div><div id=\"mf157\"><br></div><div id=\"mf159\">Courses to order: Beet-cured salmon with creme fraîche; skate grenobloise with haricots verts and fingerling potatoes; cardamom semifreddo with a flourless biscuit, caramel crémeux and chocolate ganache.</div><div id=\"mf160\"><br></div><div id=\"mf162\"><i>Available for lunch, Monday through Friday.</i></div><div id=\"mf164\"><br></div><div id=\"mf166\"><a href=\"http://gothambarandgrill.com/\" id=\"mfa21\"><b>Gotham Bar &amp; Grill</b></a></div><div id=\"mf168\">This amber-hued hall with massive floral arrangements has become a New York institution. Serving American haute cuisine in Greenwich Village since 1984, chef Alfred Portale has built his reputation around reliably excellent service and creative takes on familiar dishes.</div><div id=\"mf169\"><br></div><div id=\"mf171\">Courses to order: Wild bass crudo with a watermelon emulsion; poussin with romano beans and a white wine reduction; Gotham chocolate cake (a must).</div><div id=\"mf172\"><br></div><div id=\"mf174\"><i>Available for lunch, Monday through Friday</i></div><div id=\"mf176\"><br></div><div id=\"mf178\"><a href=\"http://hakkasan.com/locations/hakkasan-new-york/\" id=\"mfa22\"><b>Hakkasan New York</b></a></div><div id=\"mf180\">The New York City outpost of London&rsquo;s famed Chinese restaurant Hakkasan is loud, proud, and, outside of Restaurant Week, prohibitively expensive. Heavy use of Carrara marble and dark latticework are reminiscent of ancient Chinese houses.</div><div id=\"mf181\"><br></div><div id=\"mf183\">Courses to order: Steamed dim sum (more delicate than the fried option, and no less delicious); spicy prawns with almond and lily bulb; apricot cream with summer berries.</div><div id=\"mf184\"><br></div><div id=\"mf186\"><i>Available for dinner, Monday through Friday; dinner on Sunday.</i></div><div id=\"mf188\"><br></div><div id=\"mf190\"><a href=\"http://www.junoonnyc.com/\" id=\"mfa23\"><b>Junoon</b></a></div><div id=\"mf192\">Pass through the massive limestone entrance and enter the refined dining room of Junoon, with intricately carved sandstone columns. Junoon serves regional Indian cuisine rarely seen on U.S. menus and a rigorous commitment to use the freshest ingredients possible.</div><div id=\"mf193\"><br></div><div id=\"mf195\">Courses to order: Montauk oyster pakora with Meyer lemon; baby eggplant baigan; yogurt mousse and chamomile cake.</div><div id=\"mf196\"><br></div><div id=\"mf198\"><i>Available for lunch and dinner, Monday through Friday.</i></div><div id=\"mf200\"><br></div><div id=\"mf202\"><a href=\"http://tulsinyc.com/\" id=\"mfa24\"><b>Tulsi</b></a></div><div id=\"mf204\">At this intimate, 55-seat Indian restaurant in Midtown East, Goa-born chef Eric McCarthy serves some of the best tandoor in the city. Ask to sit in one of the canopied booths for the full experience.</div><div id=\"mf205\"><br></div><div id=\"mf207\">Courses to order: Tandoor-baked potato stuffed with cheese and vegetables; Goan fish curry with freshly ground coconut, tamarind and mango; lemon ginger mousse.</div><div id=\"mf208\"><br></div><div id=\"mf210\"><i>Available for lunch and dinner, Monday through Friday.</i></div><div id=\"mf212\"><br></div><div id=\"mf214\">Stop by the WestHouse concierge and our team can book reservations for these and any other New York restaurants during your stay.</div><div id=\"mf215\"><br></div><div id=\"mf217\"><i>Photo of Ai Fiori courtesy of Noah Fecks.</i></div><div id=\"mf219\"><br></div>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"]}
