While pieces at mega fairs like Frieze and Art Basel come from art-world superstars and can fetch millions, art at this New York fair sells for a more manageable maximum of $10,000. Consider yourself a novice? Not to worry&mdash;here&rsquo;s how to tour the Affordable Art Fair like a connoisseur.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Take a tour</h2>\n<p>Beginners can start with one of many guided tours. On October 2, art world expert Susan Mumford will lead Women Artists to Watch&mdash;spotlighting six women artists from the exhibiting galleries at the Affordable Art Fair. Get Mumford&rsquo;s top-notch advice on collecting contemporary art before exploring the fair.</p>\n<p>This fall, the Affordable Art Fair team-hosted Collect Yourself tours will return&mdash;with each tour focusing on an artistic topic or theme that the tour guide finds personally engaging. This year&rsquo;s topics include Asian art, photography and, perfect for New Yorkers, finds under $500 for your tiny apartment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Recharge and refresh</h2>\n<p>Pace yourself&mdash;you can&rsquo;t rush finding the perfect piece of art. After starting the day with a tour, break for the food at the caf&eacute;. The catering is by New York&rsquo;s legendary Butterfield Market, which started as a small grocery store in 1915 that delivered to the likes of Brooke Astor and John Rockefeller. The food is freshly made on-site every day, so be sure to break to enjoy a sandwich, salad or refreshment before starting your search.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Start small</h2>\n<p>The bigger the artwork, the more expensive it&rsquo;s likely to be. Starting with a more modest price tag isn&rsquo;t just an economical choice&mdash;more budget means being able to acquire more than one piece to start building your collection. Some small, featured pieces from the collection include:</p>\n<p><img id=\"image_preview\" src=\"../../assets/images/caa37d2b30b2296f7b90e5633158ce2e50a70c2d\" /></p>\n<p><strong>A Day at Rockaway, 2016</strong></p>\n<p>Medium: Oil on paper, 14 in x 11 in</p>\n<p>Price: $425</p>\n<p>Artist: Kristin Texeira</p>\n<p>Gallery: Uprise Art</p>\n<p><img id=\"image_preview\" src=\"../../assets/images/7c56620100939bbe8ee11e64653cd2ce2ca06d05\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Nocturno, 2012</strong></p>\n<p>Medium: Silkscreen with collage, 10 in x 14in</p>\n<p>Price: $650</p>\n<p>Artist: Miguel Olivares</p>\n<p>Gallery: Harris Stanton Gallery</p>\n<p><img id=\"image_preview\" src=\"../../assets/images/677e1d9a761c1e573b5d4b60f183ddb1340f8a6e\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Untitled 4 (house series), 2016 </strong></p>\n<p>Medium: Acrylic on board, 10 in x 10 in</p>\n<p>Price: $750</p>\n<p>Artist: Negin Dastgheib</p>\n<p>Gallery: 3walls</p>\n<p>And remember: a modest collection that matches your tastes and interests is more important than simply a large one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Keep these artists on your radar</h2>\n<p>Wondering who will be the next art world big shots?
