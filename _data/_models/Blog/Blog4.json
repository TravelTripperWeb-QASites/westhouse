Come the weekend, forget long brunch lines in the West Village and make reservations here under the waterfront awnings. Order the challah french toast if only for the Grand Marnier banana compote ($18).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thecentralparkboathouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Loeb Boathouse</a>: E. 72nd St., <a href=\"tel:1212-517-2233\">212-517-2233</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bryant Park: Bryant Park Grill</h2>\n<p>Bryant Park Grill, an ivy-covered cafe in the back of the New York Public Library&rsquo;s opulent Schwarzman Building overlooking Bryant Park, is one of Midtown&rsquo;s best spots for a power lunch. Ask for a rooftop seat and order the cobb salad with grilled shrimp and maytag blue cheese ($26).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://arkrestaurants.com/bryant_park/\" target=\"_blank\">Bryant Park Grill</a>: 25 W. 40th St., <a href=\"tel:1212-840-6500\">212-840-6500</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Union Square: The Pavilion</h2>\n<p>Located under neoclassical arches on the northern end of Union Square, The Pavilion has a decidedly tropical feel with palm frond fans and potted palms. The menu, inspired by the square&rsquo;s popular farmer&rsquo;s market, is similarly refreshing, with fresh salads and seafood options like branzino with a lemon chimichurri ($33). An extra boon for Sex and the City fans: Carrie Bradshaw attended a party here when it was called Luna Park, which shuttered in 2007.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thepavilionnyc.com/#home\" target=\"_blank\">The Pavilion</a>: 20 Union Sq.

Architecture firm SITE Environmental Design built the now-iconic wooden structure to blend in with its leafy surroundings.
