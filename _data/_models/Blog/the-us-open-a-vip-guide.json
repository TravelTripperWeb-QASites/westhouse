Held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, this year from August 29 until September 11, 2016, the world-class matches are less than 40 minutes from Midtown Manhattan. And just because you&rsquo;re not on a first-name basis with Novak Djokovic doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t enjoy the Open like a VIP. Here are the best ways to see the matches like an A-lister.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skip the subway.</h2>\n<p>Why deal with the crowds and transfers of subway travel when you can reserve luxury car service? Your WestHouse concierges are happy to arrange private transportation to Arthur Ashe stadium in Queens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Get the right seat.</h2>\n<p>Forego the nosebleed seats and watch the volleys from a courtside seat, or from the slightly higher seats in the loge section. Not only are the views better and your chances of sitting next to celebrities higher in these two sections, but you&rsquo;ll also have exclusive access to top-tier dining. If you can, look for tickets in courtside sections 51-55, or loge sections 127-129 as they&rsquo;re located directly behind the chair umpire, giving you the most official view of the match. No matter where you sit this year, you&rsquo;ll never run the chance of being rained out with a brand <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/u-s-open-site-major-makeover-article-1.2548254\">new retractable roof</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Eat well.</h2>\n<p>Most match spectators will eat at the Food Village, one of several venues with restaurants in the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. For exclusive fine dining, courtside ticket holders can access Aces, Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto&rsquo;s and local darling Ed White&rsquo;s high-end sushi restaurant (with a knockout wine list to boot) or Champions Bar &amp; Grill for well-prepared steaks and sauces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Meet the players.</h2>\n<p>How? Premier Tennis can organize private gatherings with elite players. Attend a lunch, a meet-and-greet or even a practice round with your favorite tennis star, while everyone else settles for seeing them from the stands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Watch the match from a luxury suite.</h2>\n<p>For your own personal Grand Slam, book one of U.S. Open&rsquo;s Luxury Suites. Box suites for twenty, parking passes, gourmet catering, and player appearances make these packages worth it&mdash;if you have upwards of $18,000 to spare.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information and to book tickets, visit the <a href=\"http://www.usopen.org/index.html\">Official Site of the 2016 US Open Tennis Championships</a>.</p>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"],"thumbnail":{"url":"/assets/images/8232/original/Screen-Shot-2015-09-01-at-12.38.36-PM.png"}}
