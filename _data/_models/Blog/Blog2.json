Guests who book our <a href=\"https://westhousehotelnewyork.reztrip.com/classic/en/special_offer?rate_code=FRIEZ1&amp;offer_code=FRIEZE&amp;utm_medium=Booknowbutton&amp;vr=3&amp;utm_term=FriezePackage&amp;utm_campaign=FriezePackage&amp;_ga=1.156570300.645160261.1454700367&amp;utm_source=WHWebsite\" target=\"_blank\">Experience Frieze Like a VIP</a> package will receive two all-access day passes, transportation to and from the event and a two-night stay in a WestHouse suite, including art-inspired truffles by MiniMelanie at turndown service. The fair, which lasts from May 5 to May 8, is a must-see. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>New York&rsquo;s coolest eats come together in one location.</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This year&rsquo;s Frieze festival is curating food from some of the city&rsquo;s most popular vendors: Frankies Spuntino, Marlow &amp; Sons, El Rey, Cosme and celebrity favorite Roberta&rsquo;s will all open outposts during the fair.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>You could get reverse pickpocketed.</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brooklyn&rsquo;s Red Hook-based artist David Horvitz, who often uses performance art as a medium for his work, has commissioned a &ldquo;pickpocket&rdquo; to work the art fair. Instead of stealing from Frieze guests, though, he&rsquo;ll be sneakily placing tiny sculptures into pockets and purses, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/project/david-horvitz\" target=\"_blank\">turning an illegal action into a gesture of generosity</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Its Project Artists will satisfy the current nostalgia for the &rsquo;80s and early &rsquo;90s.</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cecilia Alemani, director of public art for New York&rsquo;s High Line, is this year&rsquo;s Frieze Project section curator, and she&rsquo;s called on participants to &nbsp;explore &ldquo;<a href=\"http://frieze.com/article/2016-projects-artists-announced\" target=\"_blank\">the magical possibilities of artistic intervention in unexpected and often humorous ways</a>.&rdquo; Among those involved is Italian Maurizio Cattelan, whose work will pay special tribute to the defunct Daniel Newburg Gallery. The SoHo gallery had been at the center of New York&rsquo;s art scene in the 1980s and early &rsquo;90s before shutting its doors in 1994. Cattelan Cattelan, with his irreverent sculptures, was the last artist to exhibit before the gallery closed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The art is world-class.</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Frieze New York will comprise 202 galleries from 31 countries this year. One highlight will be the PPOW booth. The East Village gallery is dedicated to David Wojnarowicz, a prominent New York painter, photographer, writer, filmmaker, performance artist and activist who died of AIDS in 1992. PPOW will be selling select works by the artist in advance of his upcoming <a href=\"http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/DavidWojnarowicz\" target=\"_blank\">retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Visit the Frieze website for a <a href=\"http://friezecomfrikfrpfrl.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/fairs/frieze-new-york/galleries\" target=\"_blank\">full list of participating galleries</a>.</p>","title":"Why You Need to Attend Frieze New York 2016","seo_title":"Frieze 2016 Art Fair New York","seo_description":"Why Frieze New York is the art fair to see this spring","url_friendly_name":"frieze-nyc-2016","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029","55a40b1d28f55f08a900002b"],"date":"04/25/2016","datemeta":"2016/04/25","preview":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.6667px; line-height: 20.24px; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;\">WestHouse is proud to partner with Frieze New York, one of the world&rsquo;s leading contemporary art fairs.
