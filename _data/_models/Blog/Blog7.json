The 18th-century shingled houses and hidden estates behind boxwood hedges have long been a summer destination for NYC residents, but commuting several hours back and forth is a hassle, especially in summer traffic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are our favorite ways to get the Hamptons experience without ever leaving New York City.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Upper West Side: To dine like you&rsquo;re in East Hampton</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to dine like you&rsquo;re in the Hamptons on Manhattan, with a thriving culinary community that migrates back and forth. Two favorites on the Upper West Side:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nickandtoniscafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick and Toni&rsquo;s Cafe</a> brought wood-grilled Italian food to the Lincoln Center crowd in 1994, and has remained a neighborhood mainstay. Hand-painted frescoes decorate the walls of the Upper West Side offshoot of East Hampton favorite.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Connie McDonald and Pam Weekes left their banking and fashion careers aside when they opened <a href=\"http://www.levainbakery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Levain Bakery</a> in the mid 90s. Their quest to create the world&rsquo;s best chocolate chip cookie spread to the Hamptons, too, and now beach-goers in Wainscott can enjoy the bakers&rsquo; massive cookies. In the city, head to Levain&rsquo;s original Upper West Side location for the famous six-ounce chocolate chip walnut cookie.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nickandtoniscafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick and Toni&rsquo;s Cafe</a>: 100 W. 67th St., 212-496-4000</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.levainbakery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Levain Bakery</a>: 167 W. 74th St., 212-874-6080</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tribeca: To enjoy oysters and cocktails like you&rsquo;re in Montauk</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Montauk is home to the state&rsquo;s largest commercial fishing fleet, but there&rsquo;s no need to head there for seafood. Grand Banks in Tribeca brings a chic, laid-back beach vibe to Pier 25, serving oysters and cocktails aboard a historic wooden schooner on the Hudson River. It&rsquo;s a subtle reminder of the oyster barges that used to line Manhattan&rsquo;s waterfront in the 1700s and 1800s.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.grandbanks.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Banks</a>: Pier 25, Hudson River Park</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Red Hook, Brooklyn: To experience being on the water in Sag Harbor</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the far western edge of Long Island, rapidly-changing Red Hook is developing undertones of points east, like Sag Harbor, historical home to sailors, whalers and fishermen. To get the Sag Harbor experience in Brooklyn, take the <a href=\"https://www.nywatertaxi.com/ikea\" target=\"_blank\">water taxi from Wall Street/Pier 11</a> (free on weekends) to Brooklyn Crab. Built on two decks overlooking the New York Harbor, the multi-story bar, restaurant and mini-golf course serves the freshest seafood from all the way up the Atlantic Coast and down to the Gulf of Mexico. Around the corner from Brooklyn Crab, Sunny&rsquo;s has been around since the 1890s, and looks like the type of bar salty fishermen would frequent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brooklyncrab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn Crab</a>: 24 Reed St., Brooklyn, 718-643-2722</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sunnysredhook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunny&rsquo;s</a>: 253 Conover St., Brooklyn, 718-625-8211</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Madison Avenue: To experience Southampton's Main Street shopping</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multiple stores on Southampton&rsquo;s breezy Main Street in Southampton have flagships on Madison Avenue. Two of the big players are Brooks Brothers and J. Crew&rsquo;s upmarket Women&rsquo;s Collection. The men&rsquo;s clothier&rsquo;s Madison Avenue store features a <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/brooks-brothers-nyc\" target=\"_blank\">full-scale indoor PGA Tour simulator</a>. We also love the Women&rsquo;s Collection for its more luxurious take on J. Crew&rsquo;s classic styles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brooksbrothers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooks Brothers</a>: 346 Madison Avenue, 212-309-7765</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stores.jcrew.com/en/1035-madison-women-s-collection\" target=\"_blank\">J.Crew Women&rsquo;s Collection</a>: 1035 Madison Ave., 212-249-3869</p>"}
