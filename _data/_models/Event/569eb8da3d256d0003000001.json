Some of Stella&rsquo;s best known works are on display, alongside lesser known pieces from museums around the world. The exhibition is the most comprehensive look at Stella&rsquo;s career to date, and is co-organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Reopened just a few months ago, the Whitney has moved into a stunning new building in the Meatpacking District.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.755; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For more information, visit the <a class=\"\" href=\"http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/FrankStella\">museum&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of The Whitney Museum</em>.</p>","definition":""}
