Meet sailors, marines and coast guards as they tour NYC and host events on their ships and around town. On Memorial Day, spot the men and women in uniform (and the rest of the city it seems) at Central Park, aboard the Intrepid Air &amp; Space Museum or at a rooftop bar to enjoy the summery weather. If it&rsquo;s warm enough outside, you can even find sun worshippers at the city&rsquo;s beaches.</p>\n<p><br />For more information on Fleet Week, visit the <a class=\"\" href=\"http://www.fleetweeknewyork.com/\">event website</a>.&nbsp;</p>","definition":""}
