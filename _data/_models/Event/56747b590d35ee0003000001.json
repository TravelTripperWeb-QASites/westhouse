A cast of 90 professional dancers and alternating troupes of 50 young student dancers perform nightly at Lincoln Center&rsquo;s Avery Fisher Hall, bringing the magical Kingdom of the Sugarplum Fairy, with its fantastical cast of characters, to life.</p>\n<p><br />For tickets and information, visit the <a class=\"\" href=\"http://www.nycballet.com/Ballets/G/George-Balanchine-s-The-Nutcracker.aspx\">New York City Ballet&rsquo;s Nutcracker website</a>.</p>","definition":""}
