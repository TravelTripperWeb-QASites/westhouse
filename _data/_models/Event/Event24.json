The tree was 20-feet tall, and boasted makeshift decorations (cranberries, paper, tin cans).</p>\n<p>Today, the trees average between 69 and 100 feet, and the stately Norway spruces are adorned with tens of thousands of lights and, as of last year, a 550-pound Swarovski crystal star that adds an extra 10-feet to the top of the tree. Watch the lighting this year on November 30 during the annual event, which will feature two hours of live performances. After the official lighting, visitors can enjoy the lit tree until 9 p.m. on January 7.</p>\n<p>For more details, visit Rockefeller Center&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.rockefellercenter.com/whats-happening/2016/11/30/2016-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>","image":{"url":"/assets/images/Rockefeller-center-tree-lighting.jpg"},"seo_description":"Christmas Tree Lighting, Rockefeller Center","url_friendly_name":"christmas-tree-lighting"}
