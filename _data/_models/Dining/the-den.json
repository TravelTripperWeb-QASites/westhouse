A fresh and modern interpretation of a classic New York City speakeasy boasting an antique fireplace and intimate bar, the private lounge features a curated menu of charcuterie and crafted cocktails, including the hotel&rsquo;s unique take on the Old Fashioned; the cacao fruit-infused Oldie But Goodie finishes with a smooth kick, and is already causing a stir in trendy magazines. By design, The Den&rsquo;s raised floor means Residents are not eye-level with the street, allowing for a bird&rsquo;s eye view of passersby. Even here on the hotel&rsquo;s first-floor lobby level, the views are quintessential New York as a setting sun at cocktail hour casts golden hues on an elaborate Beaux Art building just across the street.</p><p><b>Operation Hours:</b></p><p style=\"\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;High tea: 2:00 - 4:00PM<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Light fare: 5:00 - 8:00PM<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bar opens until 11:00PM&nbsp;</p><p> <a href=\"http://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/6392/original/westhouse-hotel-new-york-menu.pdf\" class=\"\">MENU</a></p>","definition":"","menu_order":"1"}
